# MNIST-Neural-Net
This is my attempt to create a Neural Network that identifies handwritten integers between zero and nine (inclusive). I use the MNIST data set and have tried to use simple and concise code to acheive this goal. I wanted to create a version of this classic neural network that is easy to understand for beginner coders.
